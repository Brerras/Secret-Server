# Introduction

Scripts in this directory can be used for building workflows that utilize the REST API with Secret Server.

> A standard with PowerShell should move to using the PowerShell module, [Thycotic.SecretServer](https://thycotic-ps.github.io/thycotic.secretserver/).

Common examples with the module are written up in the [Working With](https://thycotic-ps.github.io/thycotic.secretserver/getting_started/working_with/) section on the public documentation. Custom workflows that fall outside of the common ones documented will be hosted here.
