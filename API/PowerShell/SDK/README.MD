# PowerShell SDK for Secret Server

Welcome to the PowerShell SDK for Secret Server. This SDK allows you to interact with Secret Server using PowerShell scripts.

## Important Notes

1. **Account Initialization**: You must open Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any other terminal using the same account that was used to initialize the SDK. This is very important.
2. **Account Consistency**: You cannot initialize different accounts in the same directory. Doing so will nullify the existing connection.
