# Introduction

This script can be used to move secrets to a destination folder based on SecretID. A SecretID column must exist within the CSV which provides all of the SecretIDs for the secrets you wish to move. 

> **Note:** The script will need modified to include your specific Secret Server instance URL in the format of https://SSURL. You will also need to include a path to the valid CSV, and a destination FolderID. It is recommended to review the script for adjustments that you may need to make before running it within an environment.
