# Introduction

This script can be used to delete dependencies associated with a specific template. You must provide the Secret Server URL, username, password, and SecretTemplateID in the script before running this against a Secret Server instance. This may be helpful for migration activities when dependencies need re-mapped.

`Note: This script does not delete the dependency group`
